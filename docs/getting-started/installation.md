## Tool Prerequisites

Tina is built with [React](https://www.reactjs.org). To run all the tools required you need at least the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8.0.0+)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (Optional. You can still use `npm` if you want, but this is for your own sanity.)

## Other Knowledge

Additionally, you should have a good working knowledge of whatever Javascript framework you are using, as setting up Tina requires a fairly intimate knowledge with component architecture to be able to customize and iterate on your bespoke version of Tina.

If you just want to start coding to learn more about how Tina works, skip to the [Gatsby Quickstart](/gatsby/quickstart)
