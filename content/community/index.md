  Tina is made better by the wisdom of crowds. Help us fundamentally shift the
  way devs & non-devs interface with content editing on the web. If you're stuck
  or have ideas for improving Tina, join our slack channel, tweet us or make an
  issue on github. Check out our contribution guidelines for more info on how to
  get involved with development. Peak at our roadmap to see what's coming down
  the line.
